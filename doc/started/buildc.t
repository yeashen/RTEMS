@chapter Building the GNU Cross Compiler Toolset with RSB

The RTEMS Projects recommends using the RTEMS Source Builder (RSB)
for building the toolset from source. RSB has evolved over time from
various instructions and scripts for building the toolset, and it removes
much of the frustration associated with building the toolset from source.
Although prebuilt binaries are much easier to install, they are harder
for the RTEMS Project to support.

Documentation for RSB is available from @uref{https://docs.rtems.org/rsb/,https://docs.rtems.org/rsb/}.
