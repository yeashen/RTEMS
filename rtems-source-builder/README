RTEMS Tools From Source
-----------------------

The RTEMS Source Builder is a tool to aid building packages from source used by
the RTEMS project. It helps consolidate the details you need to build a package
from source in a controlled and verifiable way. The tool is aimed at developers
of software who use tool sets for embedded type development and is not limited
to building just for RTEMS. Embedded development typically uses cross-compiling
tool chains, debuggers, and debugging aids. Together we call these a 'tool
set'. The RTEMS Source Builder is not limited to this role but designed to fit
with-in this specific niche. It can be used outside of the RTEMS project and we
welcome this happening in other open source or commercial projects.

The project is part of the RTEMS Project. See http://www.rtems.org/ for
details. The master repositiory is
http://git.rtems.org/rtems-source-builder.git/.

Documentation is in the 'doc' directory and available as HTML at https://docs.rtems.org/rsb/.

Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome.
